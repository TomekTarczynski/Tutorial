# PRESENTATION

Key things to consider before making a presentation:

- *Exploratory presenentation* (all 100 oysters are shown) vs *Explanatory presentation* (only 2 pearls are shown)
- Who is the target audience and what they are interested in?
- What do you want to achieve by this presentation?
- What will be the form of presentation? *Live* vs *Document*

### Planing
- Make a story board - sticky notes are great tool to do that.
- One sticky note can represent one or more slides.
- Do not focus on the exact things that will be shown rather focus on the idea

### Effective charts:
- Instead of presenting chart with two numbers just show the numbers using big font
- Remove all not neccessary borders from tables
- If the table contains a lot of numbers then contain heatmaps to drag attention
- If chart contains multiple series and only one is important then consider changing colors of all others into grey
- Try not to use diagonal text on axis
- The space between bars should be around half of the width of a bar
- Instead of using divergent colors try to use one scale of colors
- If an axis is not neccessary then remove it
- If names of categories are long then use horizontal bar graph
- If the order of magnitude of categories is different then try to use are chart
- Instead of using two axis plot add data labels and remove axis at all
- Remove all trash from presentation
	- borders
	- grid lines
	- data markers
	- decimal places


Exercises to make after the presentation is made:

- Tell the presentation in 3 minutes without showing it.
- Shorten the presentation to one sentence.
- For each slide prepare key message
