# PRESENTATION

**Before making a presentation:**

- *Exploratory presentation* (all 100 oysters are shown) vs *Explanatory presentation* (only 2 pearls are shown)
- Who is the target audience and what they are interested in?
- What do you want to achieve by this presentation?
- What will be the form of presentation? *Live* vs *Document*

**Planing**
- Make a story board - sticky notes are great tool to do that.
- One sticky note can represent one or more slides.
- Do not focus on the exact things that will be shown rather focus on the idea

**Effective charts:**
- Instead of presenting chart with two numbers just show the numbers using big font
- Remove all not necessary borders from tables
- If the table contains a lot of numbers then contain heat-maps to drag attention
- If chart contains multiple series and only one is important then consider changing colors of all others into gray
- Try not to use diagonal text on axis
- The space between bars should be around half of the width of a bar
- Instead of using divergent colors try to use one scale of colors
- If an axis is not necessary then remove it
- If names of categories are long then use horizontal bar graph
- If the order of magnitude of categories is different then try to use are chart
- Instead of using two axis plot add data labels and remove axis at all
- Remove all trash from presentation
	- borders
	- grid lines
	- data markers
	- decimal places

**Pre-attentive processing** 

This is the subconscious accumulation of information from the environment. People are processing such information first and due to that it is easy to manage their attention in the way we want: Here are some examples

**Legends**

* If possible try to use direct legend

</p>

**Highlighting**

* If one of the categories is the most important then highlight it with a color and change the color of all others into gray

Example 
* By setting proper spaces between column and rows we might indicate whether data should be read by columns (big spaces between columns) or by rows (big spaces between rows)


**Exercises to make after the presentation is made:**

- Tell the presentation in 3 minutes without showing it.
- Shorten the presentation to one sentence.
- For each slide prepare key message
